Data set description:

This data set is related to the red variants of the Portuguese wine "Vinho Verde". The data set describes the amount of various chemicals present in wine and their effect on its quality.

1. What problem does it address?

The problem that is addressed is to predict the quality of the wine using the data provided.
Knowing that there are many wines of normal, excellent and bad quality.

2. What solutions (notebooks) have already been developed?

There is a total of 273 notebooks already developed in relation to this dataset, attached the link of the top 3 of the most voted:

https://www.kaggle.com/code/qusaybtoush1990/wine-quality

3. Which of all the solutions contains the minimum necessary to be able to train a model and save a model?

In this case, I took more than one solution already published in kaggle for the project, a minimal solution to be able to train and save a model is the following:

Define the objective of the project.

It is planned to implement and deploy a supervised model (regression) to categorize wine quality.
The aim is to carry out a proof of concept and apply a couple of customer transformers to the data.

What models can be trained beyond the solution created in Kaggle?

In this case, we are not going to experiment with other extra models, but it is worth mentioning that different models can be implemented, either supervised or unsupervised.
In the case of the supervised, a decision tree, random forest, etc. can be implemented.

What would be the end result of this project?

Obtain a notebook and a documented API containing the implementation of a machine learning model applied to the wine dataset.

This dataset is also available in the Kaggle and UCI machine learning repository, https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality.
