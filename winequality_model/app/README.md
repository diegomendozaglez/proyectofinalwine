# Proyect:

Repository for Wine Model Clasiffication proyect.

## Problem context:

Dishonest manufacturers have learned to dispense a mixture of water, sugar, aniline dye and citric acid from grape wine. It is very difficult to recognize a fake, not unique suitable verification methods. I will tell you how to determine the quality of wine in accessible ways.

When choosing wine in a store, we evaluate only the appearance of the bottle, which does not always save us from counterfeiting. Now you can fake a bottle and a label of a wine company even in the basement. The similarity with the original will be one hundred percent. when this value is selected, the quality of the wine is excluded due to appearance. The wine must be tasted before serving.

The quality of wine is its normative indicator for chemical composition, color, saturation, aroma and taste.

## Overall analysis and results

The problem that is addressed is to predict the quality of the wine using the data provided. Knowing that there are many wines of normal, excellent and bad quality. And the solution (notebook) it can find in the next link: https://github.com/diegomendozaglez/proyectofinalwine/blob/main/notebook/NotebookWine1.ipynb

## Setup

### For Linux users:

* Change the directory to the `module-3/session-11/itesm_mlops/itesm_mlops` folder.
* Create a virtual environment with Python 3+:
  ```bash
  python310 -m venv venv
  ```
* Activate the virtual environment
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

![1691990047775](image/README/1691990047775.png)

If everything is ok, it will reponse back with a `message` and a `reponse_text` as you can see in the picture above, in the `reponse body`.

### Individual deployment of the API with Docker and usage

#### Build the image

* Ensure you are in the `mlops-mobilepc/` directory (root folder).
* Run the following code to build the image:

  ```bash
  docker build -t mobilepc-image ./mobilepc/mobilepc/app/
  ```
* Inspect the image created by running this command:

  ```bash
  docker images
  ```

  Output:

  ```bash

## Pre-commits

In attempt to assure quality across all modules, this proyect has a pass throug phase using Pre-commits.

Pre-commits are automated checks that run on your code before you commit changes, helping ensure code quality and consistency.

### Prerequisites

1. Python is installed on your system.
2. Visual Studio Code (VSC) is installed on your system.
3. `pip` is installed on your system.

### Step 1: Install `pre-commit`

First, you need to install the `pre-commit` tool on your system. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

### Step 2: Create a Pre-Commit Configuration File

Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` in the root of your Python project. This file will define the pre-commit hooks to be executed.

### Step 3: Configure Pre-Commit Hooks

In the  [pre-commit file](.pre-commit-config.yaml), we have defined the pre-commit hooks you want to run. Each hook represents a specific check on the code. There are many pre-configured hooks available, and you can also create custom hooks if needed.

### Step 4: Initialize Pre-Commit for Your Project

After looking the `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file, initialize pre-commit for this project. Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the root directory of this project, and run the following command:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Output

```bash
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

> **NOTE**
> If you want to see the default hidden folder `.git`, follow the steps in this link: https://linuxpip.org/vscode-show-hidden-files/

### Step 5: Commit Your Changes

With the pre-commit hooks installed, you can now make changes to the Python code. When you're ready to commit changes, run the following command to trigger the pre-commit checks:

```bash
git commit -m "add pre-commit file"
```

Output

`<summary>`Pre-commit output, click to collapse `</summary>`

    ``bash     [WARNING] The 'rev' field of repo 'https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-autopep8' appears to be a mutable reference (moving tag / branch).

Pre-commit will run all the defined hooks on the files you've staged for the commit. If any issues are found (e.g., trailing whitespace, linting errors, etc.), the commit will be halted, and you'll need to address the problems before you can successfully commit.
